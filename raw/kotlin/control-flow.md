Like other programming languages, Kotlin is capable of making decisions based on whether a piece of code is evaluated to be true. Such pieces of code are called conditional expressions . Kotlin is also able to create and iterate through loops.

## Conditional expressions

Kotlin provides `if` and `when` for checking conditional expressions.

If you have to choose between `if` and `when`, we recommend using `when` because it:

-
Makes your code easier to read.

-
Makes it easier to add another branch.

-
Leads to fewer mistakes in your code.

### If

To use `if`, add the conditional expression within parentheses `()` and the action to take if the result is true within curly braces `{}`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val d: Int
    val check = true

    if (check) {
        d = 1
    } else {
        d = 2
    }

    println(d)
    // 1
//sampleEnd
}
```

There is no ternary operator `condition ? then : else` in Kotlin. Instead, `if` can be used as an expression. If there is only one line of code per action, the curly braces `{}` are optional:

```kotlin
fun main() { 
//sampleStart
    val a = 1
    val b = 2

    println(if (a > b) a else b) // Returns a value: 2
//sampleEnd
}
```

### When

Use `when` when you have a conditional expression with multiple branches.

To use `when`:

-
Place the value you want to evaluate within parentheses `()`.

-
Place the branches within curly braces `{}`.

-
Use `->` in each branch to separate each check from the action to take if the check is successful.

`when` can be used either as a statement or as an expression. A statement doesn't return anything but performs actions instead.

Here is an example of using `when` as a statement:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val obj = "Hello"

    when (obj) {
        // Checks whether obj equals to "1"
        "1" -> println("One")
        // Checks whether obj equals to "Hello"
        "Hello" -> println("Greeting")
        // Default statement
        else -> println("Unknown")     
    }
    // Greeting
//sampleEnd
}
```

Note that all branch conditions are checked sequentially until one of them is satisfied. So only the first suitable branch is executed.

An expression returns a value that can be used later in your code.

Here is an example of using `when` as an expression. The `when` expression is assigned immediately to a variable which is later used with the `println()` function:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart    
    val obj = "Hello"    
    
    val result = when (obj) {
        // If obj equals "1", sets result to "one"
        "1" -> "One"
        // If obj equals "Hello", sets result to "Greeting"
        "Hello" -> "Greeting"
        // Sets result to "Unknown" if no previous condition is satisfied
        else -> "Unknown"
    }
    println(result)
    // Greeting
//sampleEnd
}
```

The examples of `when` that you've seen so far both had a subject: `obj`. But `when` can also be used without a subject.

This example uses a `when` expression without a subject to check a chain of Boolean expressions:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val trafficLightState = "Red" // This can be "Green", "Yellow", or "Red"

    val trafficAction = when {
        trafficLightState == "Green" -> "Go"
        trafficLightState == "Yellow" -> "Slow down"
        trafficLightState == "Red" -> "Stop"
        else -> "Malfunction"
    }

    println(trafficAction)
    // Stop
}
```

However, you can have the same code but with `trafficLightState` as the subject:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val trafficLightState = "Red" // This can be "Green", "Yellow", or "Red"

    val trafficAction = when (trafficLightState) {
        "Green" -> "Go"
        "Yellow" -> "Slow down"
        "Red" -> "Stop"
        else -> "Malfunction"
    }

    println(trafficAction)  
    // Stop
}
```

Using `when` with a subject makes your code easier to read and maintain. When you use a subject with a `when` expression, it also helps Kotlin check that all possible cases are covered. Otherwise, if you don't use a subject with a `when` expression, you need to provide an else branch.

## Conditional expressions practice

### Exercise 1

Create a simple game where you win if throwing two dice results in the same number. Use `if` to print `You win :)` if the dice match or `You lose :(` otherwise.

In this exercise, you import a package so that you can use the `Random.nextInt()` function to give you a random `Int`. For more information about importing packages, see Packages and imports .
Hint
Use the equality operator (`==`) to compare the dice results.

```kotlin
import kotlin.random.Random

fun main() {
    val firstResult = Random.nextInt(6)
    val secondResult = Random.nextInt(6)
    // Write your code here
}
```

import kotlin.random.Random

fun main() {
val firstResult = Random.nextInt(6)
val secondResult = Random.nextInt(6)
if (firstResult == secondResult)
println("You win :)")
else
println("You lose :(")
}

### Exercise 2

Using a `when` expression, update the following program so that it prints the corresponding actions when you input the names of game console buttons.

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| A | Yes |
| B | No |
| X | Menu |
| Y | Nothing |
| Other | There is no such button |

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val button = "A"

    println(
        // Write your code here
    )
}
```

fun main() {
val button = "A"

println(
when (button) {
"A" -> "Yes"
"B" -> "No"
"X" -> "Menu"
"Y" -> "Nothing"
else -> "There is no such button"
}
)
}

## Ranges

Before talking about loops, it's useful to know how to construct ranges for loops to iterate over.

The most common way to create a range in Kotlin is to use the `..` operator. For example, `1..4` is equivalent to `1, 2, 3, 4`.

To declare a range that doesn't include the end value, use the `.. `downTo` . For example, `4 downTo 1` is equivalent to `4, 3, 2, 1`.

To declare a range that increments in a step that isn't 1, use `step` and your desired increment value. For example, `1..5 step 2` is equivalent to `1, 3, 5`.

You can also do the same with `Char` ranges:

-
`'a'..'d'` is equivalent to `'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'`

-
`'z' downTo 's' step 2` is equivalent to `'z', 'x', 'v', 't'`

## Loops

The two most common loop structures in programming are `for` and `while`. Use `for` to iterate over a range of values and perform an action. Use `while` to continue an action until a particular condition is satisfied.

### For

Using your new knowledge of ranges, you can create a `for` loop that iterates over numbers 1 to 5 and prints the number each time.

Place the iterator and range within parentheses `()` with keyword `in`. Add the action you want to complete within curly braces `{}`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (number in 1..5) { 
        // number is the iterator and 1..5 is the range
        print(number)
    }
    // 12345
//sampleEnd
}
```

Collections can also be iterated over by loops:

```kotlin
fun main() { 
//sampleStart
    val cakes = listOf("carrot", "cheese", "chocolate")

    for (cake in cakes) {
        println("Yummy, it's a $cake cake!")
    }
    // Yummy, it's a carrot cake!
    // Yummy, it's a cheese cake!
    // Yummy, it's a chocolate cake!
//sampleEnd
}
```

### While

`while` can be used in two ways:

-
To execute a code block while a conditional expression is true. (`while`)

-
To execute the code block first and then check the conditional expression. (`do-while`)

In the first use case (`while`):

-
Declare the conditional expression for your while loop to continue within parentheses `()`.

-
Add the action you want to complete within curly braces `{}`.

The following examples use the increment operator `++` to increment the value of the `cakesEaten` variable.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    var cakesEaten = 0
    while (cakesEaten < 3) {
        println("Eat a cake")
        cakesEaten++
    }
    // Eat a cake
    // Eat a cake
    // Eat a cake
//sampleEnd
}
```

In the second use case (`do-while`):

-
Declare the conditional expression for your while loop to continue within parentheses `()`.

-
Define the action you want to complete within curly braces `{}` with the keyword `do`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    var cakesEaten = 0
    var cakesBaked = 0
    while (cakesEaten < 3) {
        println("Eat a cake")
        cakesEaten++
    }
    do {
        println("Bake a cake")
        cakesBaked++
    } while (cakesBaked < cakesEaten)
    // Eat a cake
    // Eat a cake
    // Eat a cake
    // Bake a cake
    // Bake a cake
    // Bake a cake
//sampleEnd
}
```

Now that you know the fundamentals of Kotlin control flow, it's time to learn how to write your own functions .

## Loops practice

### Exercise 1

You have a program that counts pizza slices until there's a whole pizza with 8 slices. Refactor this program in two ways:

-
Use a `while` loop.

-
Use a `do-while` loop.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var pizzaSlices = 0
    // Start refactoring here
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    // End refactoring here
    println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}
```

fun main() {
var pizzaSlices = 0
while ( pizzaSlices < 7 ) {
pizzaSlices++
println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
}
pizzaSlices++
println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}

fun main() {
var pizzaSlices = 0
pizzaSlices++
do {
println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
pizzaSlices++
} while ( pizzaSlices < 8 )
println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}

### Exercise 2

Write a program that simulates the Fizz buzz game. Your task is to print numbers from 1 to 100 incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz". Any number divisible by both 3 and 5 must be replaced with the word "fizzbuzz".
Hint 1
Use a `for` loop to count numbers and a `when` expression to decide what to print at each step.
Hint 2
Use the modulo operator (`%`) to return the remainder of a number being divided. Use the equality operator (`==`) to check if the remainder equals zero.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Write your code here
}
```

fun main() {
for (number in 1..100) {
println(
when {
number % 15 == 0 -> "fizzbuzz"
number % 3 == 0 -> "fizz"
number % 5 == 0 -> "buzz"
else -> "$number"
}
)
}
}

### Exercise 3

You have a list of words. Use `for` and `if` to print only the words that start with the letter `l`.
Hint
Use the `.startsWith()` function for `String` type.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val words = listOf("dinosaur", "limousine", "magazine", "language")
    // Write your code here
}
```

fun main() {
val words = listOf("dinosaur", "limousine", "magazine", "language")
for (w in words) {
if (w.startsWith("l"))
println(w)
}
}

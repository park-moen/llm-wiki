# Hot-swap Codex accounts

Running multiple Codex accounts to maximize tokens is common. Orca lets you hot-swap the active account in one click, with no re-login and no config editing. The same flow works for Claude Code accounts.

## Add accounts

1. Log into each Codex account from a terminal at least once, so the auth sits under `~/.codex`.
1. Open [Settings → Agents → Codex Accounts](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/settings).
1. Orca lists all detected accounts with their usage and current limit.
1. Give each one a friendly label — "personal", "work", etc.

## Swap accounts

Click the Codex chip in the status bar to open the account switcher. Pick an account; any new Codex session launched after that uses it. Sessions already running keep their original account until restarted.

## System default

The **System default**row is your current host Codex login under `~/.codex`. Managed accounts (added in Orca) do not rewrite that login; they run in isolated homes. Select System default when you want launches to match a terminal `codex`outside Orca.

## When config edits seem ignored

For managed Codex accounts, Orca mirrors settings from your real `~/.codex/config.toml`into the active runtime home. If that source file is missing, empty (e.g. cloud-sync still downloading), or unreadable, Accounts shows a warning: Codex keeps the **last successfully synced**settings until the source is healthy again. Fix the file at the path named in the banner, then relaunch or reselect the account.

## Rules & gotchas

- Swapping is instant — Orca rewrites the active credential pointer, it does not re-authenticate.
- Existing Codex processes keep their current account until restart.
- Usage readouts in the status bar follow the currently-active account.
- The restart chip preserves the active account at the time of restart.

## Claude Code accounts

The Claude account switcher works identically — different data directory (`~/.claude`), same UX.

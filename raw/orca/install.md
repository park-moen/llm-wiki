Download Orca for macOS, Windows, or Linux, and opt into RC builds.

## Download

Orca is a desktop app. Email yourself a link to open on macOS, Windows, or Linux:

-

**macOS:**[Apple Silicon](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases/latest/download/orca-macos-arm64.dmg) · [Intel](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases/latest/download/orca-macos-x64.dmg)

-

**Windows:**[installer](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases/latest/download/orca-windows-setup.exe)

-

**Linux:**[AppImage](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases/latest/download/orca-linux.AppImage) · [.deb](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases)

-

Older versions: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases).

### Homebrew (macOS)

Orca is also published as a Homebrew cask, auto-bumped on every stable release:

```
brew install --cask stablyai/orca/orca
```

`brew upgrade --cask orca`picks up new stable builds. The cask tracks the stable channel — for RC builds, use the GitHub Releases links above or the in-app **Check for Updates**flow described under [Updates](#updates).

## First launch

On first launch Orca will:

- Ask for access to your home directory so it can add repos.
- Offer to import `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, and Ghostty terminal settings if present.
- Drop you on an empty landing screen where you add your first repo.

## Updates

Orca auto-updates by default, tracking the **stable**channel. Stable releases are vetted; **RC (release candidate)**builds ship new features first, often daily.

There is no permanent in-app opt-in for the RC channel. Modifier clicks on **Check for Updates**([Settings → General → Updates](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/settings), or the app / Help menu):
| Modifier |  Effect | **Shift+click** |  Include the latest **RC**prerelease | **Cmd+click**(macOS) / **Ctrl+click**(Windows/Linux) |  Latest **perf**-tagged prerelease | **Option+click**(macOS only) |  Pick a **validated local macOS build**that passes Orca’s compatibility checks

You can still download any build directly from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases).

Don't like the current update

Older versions are always available on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases). Orca will not force-downgrade your worktree data if you go back.

## Platform notes

### macOS

Signed and notarized. On first launch, macOS may still ask you to confirm — that's normal for Electron-based apps.

### Windows

The default shell can be set to PowerShell or CMD under [Settings → Terminal](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/settings). Most users want PowerShell.

### Linux

AppImage and `.deb`builds are available. See the Releases page for details.

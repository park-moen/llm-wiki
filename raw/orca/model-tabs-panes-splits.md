Drag-to-split panes, tab groups, and pinned boundaries.

Orca's pane system is designed for watching multiple agents work without losing context. Tabs group into panes; panes split into layouts.

## Tabs

Each tab holds one thing: a terminal, an editor buffer, a browser, a diff, a PR. Tabs live inside a **tab group**.

- Drag a tab up-down within a group to reorder.
- Drag a tab onto another group to move it.
- Close every editor file tab in the active worktree with `Cmd+Option+W`on macOS or `Ctrl+Alt+W`on Windows / Linux.
- An active-tab color bar marks which pane is focused.

### Switching tabs

Default chords on **new installs**:
| Action |  macOS |  Linux / Windows |  Next / previous tab (all types) | `Cmd+Shift+]`/ `Cmd+Shift+[` | `Ctrl+Shift+]`/ `Ctrl+Shift+[` |  Next / previous tab (same type) | `Cmd+Option+]`/ `Cmd+Option+[` | `Ctrl+Alt+]`/ `Ctrl+Alt+[` |  Previous recent tab | `Ctrl+Tab` | `Ctrl+Tab`

Remap under [Settings → Shortcuts](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/settings). Existing installs keep customized overrides in `~/.orca/keybindings.json`.

## Split panes

Drag a tab to the edge of a pane to create a split:

- **Right edge**— splits left/right (horizontal split).
- **Bottom edge**— splits top/bottom (vertical split).

Splits nest. You can have an agent terminal on the left, a diff view on the top-right, and a browser tab on the bottom-right — all at once.

![Any tab type can split with any other — agent terminal, diff, browser, editor, PR view all coexist in one pane tree.](https://www.onorca.dev/whats-new/split-anything.webp) Any tab type can split with any other — agent terminal, diff, browser, editor, PR view all coexist in one pane tree.

Terminal tabs can also split inside the tab. Use the terminal tab menu for **Split terminal right**or **Split terminal down**, or use the split button in the active terminal pane header for a right split.

## Pinned boundaries

Pane boundaries stay where you put them. Resizing the window doesn't shuffle your layout; boundary positions are saved per worktree.

## Tab groups across worktrees

Each worktree owns its own tab layout. Switching worktrees swaps the entire pane tree — your browser tab, terminal, and diff reappear exactly as you left them.

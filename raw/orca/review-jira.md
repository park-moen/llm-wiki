Browse, edit, and link Jira Cloud or self-hosted Server/Data Center issues to worktrees the same way you link Linear or GitHub items.

Jira sits next to GitHub and Linear in the task drawer. Browse Jira issues, update them, and create a worktree from any issue without leaving Orca.

## Connect a Jira site

1. Open the **Tasks**sidebar entry and pick **Jira**from the source picker — Jira sits next to GitHub and Linear by default, even before any credentials are saved.
1. Click **Connect Jira**. The **Connect Jira site**dialog appears.
1. Choose **Cloud**or **Self-hosted (Server / Data Center)**.

**Cloud**

- **Jira Cloud site URL**— e.g. `https://example.atlassian.net`.
- **Atlassian email**— the address on your Atlassian account.
- **Atlassian API token**— create one at [id.atlassian.com → Security → API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).

**Self-hosted**

- **Jira base URL**— your Server/DC base (including path if Jira is not at `/`).
- Auth method:

  - **Personal access token**— Bearer PAT (preferred on modern Server/DC).
  - **Username and password**— Basic auth for older instances without PATs.

1. Click **Connect**. Orca verifies the credentials and loads your sites.

You can connect more than one Atlassian site. The Tasks header has a site picker once a site is connected; choose **All sites**to combine issues across them.

If you don't use Jira at all, hide it from the source picker via [Settings → Tasks](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/settings).

## Using Jira

- The task drawer shows GitHub, Linear, and Jira issues in a unified list once each source is enabled.
- Open an issue to see the full description, comments, and metadata in a side drawer. Edit status (via available transitions), priority, assignee, and custom fields inline.
- Add a comment from the drawer's comment composer.
- **New Jira issue**keeps title and description if you dismiss the dialog by accident — Escape, Cancel, outside click, or close. Text restores when you reopen the dialog in the same app session; drafts clear after a successful create and do not survive an app restart. Issue type and other pickers still use their usual open-time defaults.
- Creating a worktree from a Jira issue pre-fills the task name and links the worktree to the issue, so the review and the issue stay tied together.
- From the **Create workspace**dialog you can also paste a Jira issue URL (`https://…/browse/ABC-123`) into the name field, or switch the field to **Jira**search and pick an issue by text. Orca fills the workspace name, links the issue, and shows the key + summary on the worktree card with **View on Jira**. Paste is multi-site aware: when more than one connected site matches the URL origin, Orca asks which site to use; when none match, it says the site is not connected.
- Orca remembers your last-used task source per repo, so a Jira-driven repo defaults to Jira on next open.
Where credentials live

Your Atlassian API token or self-hosted credentials are encrypted via the OS keychain and stored locally — they're only used to call your configured Jira site. Revoke tokens from Atlassian account settings if you stop using Orca.

## Next steps

- [Hosted reviews, issues & Actions](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/review/github) — hand off the worktree to a hosted review once the Jira issue is in progress.
- [Commit & push from Orca](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/review/commit-push) — ship the branch without leaving Orca.
